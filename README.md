# INFO448-QuizDroid (Basics)
* An application that will allow users to take multiple-choice quizzes.

## Stories
* As a user, when I start the app, I should see a list of different topics on which to take a quiz. (For now, these should be hard-coded to read "Math", "Physics", and "Marvel Super Heroes", as well as any additional topics you feel like adding into the mix.)
* As a user, when I select a topic from the list, it should take me to the "topic overview" page, which displays a brief description of this topic, the total number of questions in this topic, and a "Begin" button taking me to the first question.
* As a user, when I press the "Begin" button from the topic overview page, it should take me to the first question page, which will consist of a question (TextView), four radio buttons each of which consist of one answer, and a "Submit" button.
* As a user, when I am on a question page and I press the "Submit" button, if no radio button is selected, it should do nothing. If a radio button is checked, it should take me to the "answer" page. (Ideally, the Submit button should not be visible until a radio button is selected.)
* As a user, when I am on the "answer" page, it should display the answer I gave, the correct answer, and tell me the total number of correct vs incorrect answers so far ("You have 5 out of 9 correct"), and display a "Next" button taking me to the next question page, or else display a "Finish" button if that is the last question in the topic.
* As a user, when I am on the "answer" page, and it is the last question of the topic, the "Finish" button should take me back to the first topic-list page, so that I can take a new quiz.

## Implementation Notes
* You can use either separate Activities or one Activity + multiple Fragments to build this; this is entirely up to you, and there's pros/cons with each approach
* It's helpful to spend some time thinking about how an MVC approach would work with this, and design accordingly
* Keep in mind almost all the text (questions, topics, etc) will be loaded dynamically in future parts of this homework, which may influence some of your decisions now

## Grading (5 pts)
* repo should be called 'quizdroid'; do work on branch 'basicui'
* We will clone and build it from the GH repo
* 1 pt for each story

## Extra credit
* As a user on the question page, if I hit the "back" button it should NOT take me to the answer summary page of the previous question, but to the previous question page directly. (1 pt)
* As a user on the first question page of a topic, hitting "back" should take me back to the topic list page, not the topic overview page. (1 pt)
